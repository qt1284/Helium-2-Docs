# IoT Helium sensor system

## Background - Helium provides decentralized long-range connection to IoT (Internet of Things) devices such as smart door locks, sensors, smart fire alarms, etc. 

## Problem - Helium application normally just provide singular product rather than an IoT device systems.

## Solution - providing a centralized hub that associates with an application which will connect and control to all other IoT devices. These devices would potentially provide values overtime through Helium mining which is a process where users are reward with helium coins by enxtending the network. 

## Value Proposition 
   ### For home owner, small business
   ### Who wants/needs to keep track of usual detectable activities such as someone walks in store, someone unlocks the door, etc.
   ### Our solution: Helium hub/Helium sensor system. 
   ### is a business category
   ### That provides a system where user can track activities and also earn money overtime.
   ### Unlike normal smart devices where it does not gain profit overtime. 
## Use case 
   ### user can use the app to track the datas being sent and helium coins being mined.
